This is a work in progress!

## Tech Stack: 
[Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/)

[Albumentations](https://albumentations.ai/docs/) for augmentations

[Semi-Supervised ImageNet1K Models](https://github.com/facebookresearch/semi-supervised-ImageNet1K-models/blob/master/hubconf.py) for modeling

## Task description:

---

In this [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/hubmap-organ-segmentation), we'll **identify and segment functional tissue units (FTUs)** accross **five** human organs:

* Prostate
* Spleen
* Lung
* Kidney
* Large Intestine

The challenge in this competition is to build algorithms that **generalize**:
* across different **organs** and
* across different **dataset** differences

=> This is a **semantic segmentation** problem.

## Data description:

---

They only release public *Human Protein Atlas (HPA)* data for the training dataset. However, they will release private *HPA* data and *Human BioMolecular Atlas Program (HuBMAP)* for their public test set. For the private test set, they only use *HuBMAP* data.

## Methodology:

---

Since we donâ€™t have the computation resources, we will focus more on **data augmentation**, **data collection**, **hyperparameter tuning**, and **post-processing**.


### Data preparation + preprocessing:

* **Class imbalance**: collect external data on many stains of PAS, H&E, DAB/H of the target organs, augment imbalance classes using the pyramid blending technique

* **Staining and imaging protocols**: -> inter- and intra-class variability -> augmentation: basic, morphology, color 

<img src='imgs/inter_intra_variability.png'>

* **Gaussian Laplacian Pyramid Blending**: generate more data within classes. This technique aims to improve the generalization ability of ML algorithms dealing with HIs. Demo from blending image + mask from large intestine

<img src='imgs/li_blending.png'>

* **Data standardization**: using avg mean and std

* **Tissue, artifact, and background**: -> deep tissue detector (filtering techniques like triangle, Otsu, CNN): -> detect tissue, artifact, and background ->reduce the quantity, increase the quality of the image data to be analyzed -> only tissues are selected for further analysis. Tissue augmentation using Otsu's binarization technique. Demo:

<img src='imgs/otsu_thresholded_img.png'>

### Model architecture:
* UNeXt101: based on U-NET architecture with a semi-weakly supervised ResNet101 as a backbone encoder
* Transfer learning to reduce the risk of overfitting
* UNeXt50 (baseline)

### Training, validation setup:
* Training + validation: 70-30 or 80-20 split
  * WSIs or tile-wise images: important that the partition between training, validation and test-set is at the patient-level -> partition patients between the sets is a good first step
  * CV, bootstrapping
* Loss functions: BCE, and symmetric Lovasz
* Iterations: 1000 with slicing learning rates (higher learning rate in the beginning and gradually decreasing learning rate in the end)

### Inference:
* **Metric**: mean Dice coefficient
* **Post-processing**:
  * Center tiling -> assume all the masks are in the center tiles -> only predict and average predictions on the center tiles
  * Cascade PSP (optional)
* **Result visualization**

* Evaluation and Inference of the predictions from multiple models with Test Time Augmentation(TTA)
